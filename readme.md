Thank you for taking the time to look at my code
There are tests inside the main rb file and in the test.rb file

Running instructions:
  first navigate to the directory that these files are in.
  To print out a table of the first 10 primes, run the following command:

      ruby prime_numbers.rb


  To Print out a table of the first N primes, enter an integer argument after the command

      eg.

        ruby prime_numbers.rb 5

          =>
            [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
            [2, 4, 6, 10, 14]
            [3, 6, 9, 15, 21]
            [5, 10, 15, 25, 35]
            [7, 14, 21, 35, 49]



Time and Space complexity:

Time: O(n^2) + n
Space: O(1)
